# AndroidFlowerClassifier

This is an Android App which classifies flower using a pre trained deep learning model. Since training of Deep Learning models is computationaly expensive, transfer learning has been used here.

This model is trained on the ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge dataset. These models can differentiate between 1,000 different classes, like Dalmatian or dishwasher.

For our flower classifier, this model is retrained on Flower images of the following five categories:
Daisy,Sunflower,Roses,Dandelion and Tulips.

The retrained model was then used in an app to predict.
